  * *Improved client performance by using [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html code splitting]* -- now each tab except Dashboard and About has it's own JS file, meaning that initial load is small (200KB, was 450KB) and tabs are loaded on demand when used. This will ensure that in future with new tabs performance will not degrade
  * Adjusted API key handling as discussed [http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1371652 here]. Invalid api keys will be automatically removed by application
