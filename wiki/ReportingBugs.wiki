#summary How to report bugs

= Reporting bugs =

== Using forums ==
You can post your finding on forums: [http://www.eveonline.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=1406328 EVE Forum Thread] or [http://forum.eve-ru.com/index.php?showtopic=57609 EVE-RU Forum Thread]. But this is _not recommended way_, but totally acceptable.

== Using issue tracker ==

This is the _recommended way_. I will basically do the same when you report something on forums.

Go to `Issues` tab and click on `New issue`
